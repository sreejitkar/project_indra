	The world is on the verge of finishing its almost all sources of non-renewable
energy. The current technologies can only predict an approximate electrical
consumption in households and other institutions. The prediction of power
usage is useful only when we have an efficient way of using the electrical
power that is being produced. The idea of the project is to develop a wifi-based
network which would be used to monitor the electrical systems in urban
households and would be connected to the local wifi system (Hub).
The world of energy is changing. There is a global urge to drastically reduce CO2
emissions in order to slow down global warming. 

Nations are reducing their dependency on imported fossil fuels by stimulating energy
savings and the use of renewable energy. 

Sustainable sources, such as solar and wind energy, are not always available. Integrating
large shares of renewable energy in our current energy supply system in a reliable way
provides a real challenge.

Nations are reducing their dependency on imported fossil fuels by stimulating energy
savings and the use of renewable energy. Sustainable sources, such as solar and wind energy, are not always available. Integrating large shares of renewable energy in our current energy supply system in a reliable wayprovides a real challenge. Our energy use is shifting towards electricity. This trend is accelerated by the fast-growing fleet of electric vehicles and the increase of electric space heating and cooling.The electrification of our energy use adds to the challenges that our future energy supply system faces.Our project proposal is to develop a wireless based network which would be used to monitor the electrical systems in urban households and would be connected to the local wireless system (Hub).
